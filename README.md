This repository is to help grasp and understand how to use Github for future projects


My name is Christian Watson. I am a 5th year Electrical Engineering major from Madison, MS. I am aiming to enter the power industry after my time at MSU, primarily focusing on the solar industry. I am excited to do this assigment as I have used Github in the past, but it has been quite some time since then.
